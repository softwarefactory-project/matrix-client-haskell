> [matrix] is an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

This project contains Haskell libraries for [matrix.org](https://matrix.org).
This allows you to rapidly integrate matrix events in your application.

## Contribute

To work on this project you need a Haskell toolchain, for example on fedora:

```ShellSession
$ sudo dnf install -y ghc cabal-install && cabal update
```

Run the tests:

```ShellSession
$ ./bin/run-tests
```

Some tests requires a local matrix server, run integration service:

```ShellSession
# In another terminal:
$ nix develop -c conduit-start
# Before running cabal test:
$ export $(nix develop -c conduit-setup)
$ cabal test all
```

Restart the commands to run the test on a fresh environment.

If you experience any difficulties, please don't hesistate to raise an issue.
